Confidence: Moderate-High.\n- Immediate action: Block domains/URLs/IPs, purge emails, and enable targeted detections; monitor for credential reuse.\n\n## Input Summary\n- Timeframe: 2025-05-20 to 2025-05-22; Industry: Financial Services; TLP: AMBER\n- IOCs: service@notifications-paypal[.]com; notifications-paypal[.]com; https://notifications-paypal[.]com/secure/validate?session=98af1; IP 185.203.116.75; SHA256 7f2c4f0b49a27f0b8b0a93d2f2bbd4e9c9a7a0e7f6f0d1c4b2a0d9c1a4f3b2d1\n\n## Enriched Observables\n- Email: service@notifications-paypal[.]com — Suspicious (spoof of brand); first_seen: unknown; last_seen: 2025-05-22; sources: internal email gateway\n- Domain: notifications-paypal[.]com — Likely malicious (brand impersonation, recent registration patterns typical in phishing); passive DNS shows limited history; WHOIS: privacy-protected; registrar: common for throwaway domains\n- URL: /secure/validate?session=98af1 — Malicious (credential harvesting path pattern); URL scan suggests login-like content\n- IP: 185.203.116.75 — Suspicious; ASN in hosting provider; geo: EU; open ports likely 80/443\n- File Hash (HTML): 7f2c...b2d1 — Malicious HTML smuggling/redirect (per multi-engine reputation)\n\n## Threat Assessment\n- Likely Technique: ATT&CK T1566.002 (Phishing: Spearphishing Link), T1204 (User Execution), T1056.001 (Input Capture - web forms)\n- Goal: Credential theft for financial platforms or corporate SSO; potential downstream account takeover\n- Actor/Malware: Not attributed; consistent with commodity phishing-as-a-service kits\n\n## Risk and Confidence\n- Likelihood: High — Campaign observed across multiple recipients with brand spoofing and active infrastructure\n- Impact: Medium — Credentials could enable unauthorized access; compensating controls may limit blast radius\n- Overall Risk: High\n- Confidence: Moderate-High — Corroborated by multiple signals (email, proxy, attachment hash)\n\n## Recommended Actions\n- Immediate (0–24h)\n  - Block domain/URL/IP at email, proxy, DNS, and endpoint controls\n  - Purge matching emails from mailboxes; disable link tracking redirections\n  - Force password resets for users who clicked/posted credentials; review MFA prompts for anomalies\n- Next 48h\n  - Add brand impersonation rules (DKIM/DMARC strict, lookalike domain detections)\n  - Monitor for logins to PayPal/financial services and SSO from unusual IPs/ASNs\n  - Hunt for the HTML hash in email stores and endpoints\n- 2+ weeks\n  - Implement inline phishing protection and user-reporting workflows; run targeted awareness campaign\n  - Consider domain monitoring for lookalikes of core brands\n\n## Detection Content\n- Splunk (Email gateway)\n  - index=email (sender_domain=\"notifications-paypal.com\" OR sender=\"*@notifications-paypal.com\" OR url_domain=\"notifications-paypal.com\")\n- Splunk (Proxy/DNS)\n  - index=proxy OR index=dns (dest_domain=\"notifications-paypal.com\" OR url=\"*notifications-paypal.com/secure/validate*\")\n- Microsoft 365 Defender (KQL)\n  - EmailEvents | where SenderFromDomain =~ \"notifications-paypal.com\" or Urls has \"notifications-paypal.com/secure/validate\"\n\n## Evidence and References\n- Reputation/enrichment: VT/URL scanners, WHOIS, passive DNS (queried 2025-05-22 UTC)\n- ATT&CK: https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/002/ (accessed 2025-05-22)\n\n## Open Questions / Missing Information\n- Exact number of recipients and click-throughs?\n- Any SSO login attempts following email deliveries?\n- Mail headers for DKIM/SPF/DMARC results?\n```"
